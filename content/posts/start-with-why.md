The message of the book is straightforward. Start with Why instead of what and how. Several takeaways from the book: 

1. You can constructively challenge presumptions and assumptions by exploring their reasons to exist.
2. Asking why can reveal problems that are wasting resources.
3. You can inspire people if you explain the why clearly to them.
4. "Why" can help you find the people you need or join the groups you feel belong to. Start with why we need them instead and explain why we are doing what we are doing. 
5. Innovation and novelty are not the same things. Many developments in the industry are novel iterations, not innovations. The definition of novelty: Novelty is simply an incremental change to an existing product designed to help marketers differentiate their products from the competition.
6. It is "Why" that builds loyalty, not manipulation, even though the manipulation works for a short time.

My personal opinions about the message of the book:

There will be some exceptional moments where we cannot or won't start with why. But, I think it won't prevent us from exploring the why later on. And sometimes, how or what will affect the why. For instance, your "I want to end hunger in the world" will most likely change once you figure out how hard the "how" is or perhaps how unrealistic it is. Hence, the why should be realistic and attainable enough not to conflict with the how and what. But this is one person speaking. Some want to keep the "Why" so high, not feeling the satisfaction of achievement, hence keeping growing or working. In the end, how we will incorporate "why" into our lives depends on us.

Unfortunately, I found the book remarkably repetitive. For those who love to start every section with lots of stories, you may like it. The positive thing about the book, though, they used clear titles and headers.
