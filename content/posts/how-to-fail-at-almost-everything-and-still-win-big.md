There are few books that I liked as much as Scott Adams’ book. I have found his mindset very close to mine, and the things he said in this book resonated with me for this reason. Unlike other books, I won’t list everything I liked in the book since it would be impossible for a LinkedIn post to cover them all. But there are a couple of things I especially liked in his mentality:

1. Seeking the opportunities in every failure; hence, turning them into practical gains. His way of looking at things almost renders them not a loss at all. They are just events, and you benefit from them regardless of their nature.
2. Simplifying complex thoughts and processes to make them practical.
3. Every skill we acquire is to be ready when luck knocks on our door and helps it find us easier.
4. Focusing on yourself and your economy first to be less dependent on the people around you. Working tirelessly for everyone to the point of harming your health and finance is not a badge of honor.
5. Learning basic skills like communication, writing, accounting, public speaking, negotiating is essential. Every new skill will make you more desirable for luck.
6. Similar to what made capitalism successful, which is profit, energy is a fundamental goal for humans. Find activities that increase your energy level.
7. We are not so rational all the time. We can use the non-rational side of our brains to deliver analytical results. For instance, if believing that alcohol is devil’s urine helps you stay sober, perfect.
8. Think of yourself as a moist robot—good inputs in, good outputs out.
9. Understand your bottlenecks, and instead of fighting them, see if you can replace them. For instance, replace the desire for eating white bread with allowing yourself to eat healthy alternatives in a limitless amount.

This book will stay in my office with my notes in them and will be a reference book for years to come until I experiment with all of the ideas in them.
