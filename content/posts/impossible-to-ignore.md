I am still reading this book, and it is one of the most exciting books I am reading recently, so I decided to do a quick shoutout for it.

Tapping into human memories and becoming a part of their subconscious is a powerful way to deliver memorable messages. Once the message is memorable, it is more likely that people will act on your initial message. But how does that work?

Your message has to be their future, not present! What happens in the future? Whatever people intend to do! Once we know the intention, we can deliver the right cue!

Cue? It is what reminds them of our message. For instance, compare “Call me later.” and “Call me at 2:00 PM”. Which one is more memorable? The second one. Why? It has time as the cue, and the cue is from the future.

You became a part of their future, and they acted on it. But just because you asked me to call you, what should I remember it?

You will remember it if you need something from me, for instance. You remember if that is important for you. Because my early message had elements vital for you, that’s how I delivered my message. I knew your intentions to buy a new computer and I said I know one that works great for me. I intrigued you by knowing your intentions. It was your future action. I injected myself into it.

Some sample messages delivered with these in mind:
