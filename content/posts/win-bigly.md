My review on the book “Win Bigly” by Scott Adams:

Persuasion is clearly crucial for success. It is everywhere. It is almost impossible to escape from it. We use it even we don’t realize it. It is fine until it is not. Some people engineer their persuasion skills. It is like fire. You can use it for cooking delicious food or hurting others.

Scott Adams explains the practical use of persuasion using Donald Trump as an example. He claims that Donald Trump is a master-level persuader. With his skillful storytelling, Scott Adams delivers persuasive content about persuasion.

The book is built on one fundamental assumption: Humans are irrational more than they are not. If they are irrational, they can be re-programmed. They are moist robots. Given the right inputs, you can get the expected outputs from them.

Persuasion does not guarantee a result all the time. But it increases the chance of getting your message to the minds of people.

For instance, the things you think most will irrationally rise in importance in your mind. It does not matter if it is correct or wrong information. So the question becomes how to get a message to be more memorable so that it looks important. Simple. Keep it simple. Use visuals. Deliver it in such a way that creates images in readers’ minds.

Potentially more evil persuasion techniques don’t ask for rational arguments. It requires the understanding of human behavior at a different level. This is where I stop.
