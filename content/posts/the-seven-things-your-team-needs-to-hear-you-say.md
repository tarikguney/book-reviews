My review for “The seven things your team needs to hear you say it”

It is another book that will stay with me at the office as a constant reminder. It is a practical book. It gives simple actionable suggestions that you can start using right away. Before I tell you the 7 things, change in your current self can be instigated if you surround yourself with the right people, build the right environment with lots of cues, and decide on the right problem to start with.

The seven things they need to hear you say to them:

1. You can. This is the empowerment they need. If they are stuck, encourage your team.
2. Try it. We won’t know everything. But this should not stop us from trying it. Let them try!
3. Believe. We are not robots. We need to believe in our cause. We need to be made believed in our cause.
4. How can I help? The team needs help. Not the kind of help they can manage but the kind of help only your position get for them.
5. I apologize. That’s the most fundamental human connection among people. It reminds us and others our human side.
6. That will not happen here. Don’t tolerate people who won’t pull their own weight and become a burden on others.
7. Nice! Compliment people for their great work. Be specific.

But do you know who the best manager is? The one who never ceases to learn :)
