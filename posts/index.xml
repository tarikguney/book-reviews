Decisive will take its place in my top books. Let&amp;rsquo;s review it.
Over time, I started to dislike one thing in my decision-making journey: feeling stuck in binary choices. And time after time, I benefited more from the &amp;ldquo;AND&amp;rdquo; than the &amp;ldquo;OR&amp;rdquo; decisions. When people consulted me for their problems, I often saw this same problem in their decisions too.</description></item><item><title>The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/</guid><description>My review of The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni
Great managers can detect the symptoms and signals of inefficiencies within their teams. They can also identify them in other teams, for the symptoms usually exhibit similar patterns. Detecting these signals is a critical step of the rest.
One typical signal is the absence of attention to the team results. The team individuals don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention and show passion towards their team goals.</description></item><item><title>The Amazon Way by John Rossman</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/amazons-way/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/amazons-way/</guid><description>My review of the book “Amazon Way” by John Rossman: What’s the simplest yet hardest reason behind Amazon’s success? I would answer it as defining straightforward principles and uncompromisingly executing them.
As I grow in my own career; every day, I am reminded of one of the most critical drivers of successful leadership, and that is the consistent expectation and execution of higher standards for your teams. Every small exception results in more exceptions.</description></item><item><title>Working With Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/working-with-emotional-intelligence/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/working-with-emotional-intelligence/</guid><description>Companies care about emotional intelligence more than technical knowledge (cognitive intelligence), but why?
The answer is hidden in the definition of “Emotional Intelligence,” which means to be able to recognize, express, and control your emotions. It also includes the ability to work with others.
Recognizing and controlling your emotions is not for drama but to understand what influences your feelings and how you can channel them for the better. For instance, you can use your fear to know if you successfully get of your comfort zone, and the same fear can also tell if you are too far from your comfort zone, which might hurt more than benefit.</description></item><item><title>The Language of Leadership by Joel Schwartzberg</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-language-of-leadership/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-language-of-leadership/</guid><description>My Review of the book &amp;ldquo;The Language of Leadership&amp;rdquo; Language is the essential skill of a leader. Using the power of language, leaders share their vision, address problems, and mobilize people. Effective communicators are exalted; ineffective communicators are excused.
There are two essential elements of effective communication: Purpose and Power. The purpose is the vision communicated in your message. The power is to grab and keep the attention of those who listen to you.</description></item><item><title>The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-phoenix-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-phoenix-project/</guid><description>My review of the book &amp;ldquo;The Phoenix Project.&amp;rdquo; Not everyone knows the pain behind the evolution of software development and operations of today&amp;rsquo;s more modern techniques and methodologies.
They are still not perfectly easy, but they were horrible back then. Agile SDLC, Scrum and Kanban, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration, and many others are not simply lip-services. They were developed after many long and painful experiences and still see revisions today.</description></item><item><title>The Hard Things About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-hard-things-about-hard-things/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-hard-things-about-hard-things/</guid><description>My review of the book “The hard things about hard things” by Ben Horowitz. Do you feel like you don’t know what to do as the CEO of your company? Well, Ben Horowitz didn’t either. But what he saw in his career is that the great CEOs didn’t quit. It was not how much they knew but how courageous they were that mattered most of the time. Experience follows ambition.</description></item></channel></rss>
