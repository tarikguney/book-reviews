Decisive will take its place in my top books. Let&amp;rsquo;s review it.
Over time, I started to dislike one thing in my decision-making journey: feeling stuck in binary choices. And time after time, I benefited more from the &amp;ldquo;AND&amp;rdquo; than the &amp;ldquo;OR&amp;rdquo; decisions. When people consulted me for their problems, I often saw this same problem in their decisions too.</description></item><item><title>The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/</guid><description>My review of The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni
Great managers can detect the symptoms and signals of inefficiencies within their teams. They can also identify them in other teams, for the symptoms usually exhibit similar patterns. Detecting these signals is a critical step of the rest.
One typical signal is the absence of attention to the team results. The team individuals don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention and show passion towards their team goals.</description></item><item><title>The Amazon Way by John Rossman</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/amazons-way/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/amazons-way/</guid><description>My review of the book “Amazon Way” by John Rossman: What’s the simplest yet hardest reason behind Amazon’s success? I would answer it as defining straightforward principles and uncompromisingly executing them.
As I grow in my own career; every day, I am reminded of one of the most critical drivers of successful leadership, and that is the consistent expectation and execution of higher standards for your teams. Every small exception results in more exceptions.</description></item><item><title>Working With Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/working-with-emotional-intelligence/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/working-with-emotional-intelligence/</guid><description>Companies care about emotional intelligence more than technical knowledge (cognitive intelligence), but why?
The answer is hidden in the definition of “Emotional Intelligence,” which means to be able to recognize, express, and control your emotions. It also includes the ability to work with others.
Recognizing and controlling your emotions is not for drama but to understand what influences your feelings and how you can channel them for the better. For instance, you can use your fear to know if you successfully get of your comfort zone, and the same fear can also tell if you are too far from your comfort zone, which might hurt more than benefit.</description></item><item><title>The Language of Leadership by Joel Schwartzberg</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-language-of-leadership/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-language-of-leadership/</guid><description>My Review of the book &amp;ldquo;The Language of Leadership&amp;rdquo; Language is the essential skill of a leader. Using the power of language, leaders share their vision, address problems, and mobilize people. Effective communicators are exalted; ineffective communicators are excused.
There are two essential elements of effective communication: Purpose and Power. The purpose is the vision communicated in your message. The power is to grab and keep the attention of those who listen to you.</description></item><item><title>The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-phoenix-project/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-phoenix-project/</guid><description>My review of the book &amp;ldquo;The Phoenix Project.&amp;rdquo; Not everyone knows the pain behind the evolution of software development and operations of today&amp;rsquo;s more modern techniques and methodologies.
They are still not perfectly easy, but they were horrible back then. Agile SDLC, Scrum and Kanban, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Integration, and many others are not simply lip-services. They were developed after many long and painful experiences and still see revisions today.</description></item><item><title>The Hard Things About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-hard-things-about-hard-things/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-hard-things-about-hard-things/</guid><description>My review of the book “The hard things about hard things” by Ben Horowitz. Do you feel like you don’t know what to do as the CEO of your company? Well, Ben Horowitz didn’t either. But what he saw in his career is that the great CEOs didn’t quit. It was not how much they knew but how courageous they were that mattered most of the time. Experience follows ambition.</description></item><item><title>The Culture Map by Erin Meyer</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-culture-map/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-culture-map/</guid><description>My book review of Culture Map by Erin Meyer: One book you must read before managing or doing business with people from other cultures.
Culture is not straightforward. What is respectful for others might not be for you. But, once you miss the difference there, all good intentions turn into bitter conflicts, literally for nothing. You lose trust, friendships, and businesses.
What defines proper communication is barely communication itself. It is not about talking directly or indirectly, as some cultures prefer.</description></item><item><title>Leading From the Middle by Scott Mautz</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/leading-from-the-middle/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/leading-from-the-middle/</guid><description>My review on “Leading from the Middle” book:
Are you suffocating when you do your management job because you feel like you are being pulled away in multiple directions? It is the case for many managers, partly because they lack the proper mindset or skillset or both, and that is okay. We will learn new things about our job for years to come. However, learning only on the act will potentially cause learning fatigue because of the emotional baggage that comes with constant failures.</description></item><item><title>Pre-suasion by Robert Cialdini</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/presuasion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/presuasion/</guid><description>My review on Pre-suasion Book
How rational are we? What if someone tells us we are less rational than we think. In fact, a lot less rational we tend to believe. Pre-suasion is not telling it to us but trying to prove it with real-world examples and scientific evidence. The result? It is scary, real scary. One fact though, these techniques are not guaranteed to work all the time. They are to increase the persuasive power of your message.</description></item><item><title>The Mental Toughness Book by Damon Zahariades</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-mental-toughness-book/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/the-mental-toughness-book/</guid><description>My review of “Mental Toughness” book:
Life is hard. But, what makes it even harder is our perception of it. But if our perception can make it harder, can it make our life easier? It certainly can.
The more we get loose from the reality, more our frustrations grow that much because our expectations don’t match what is out there. In this subjectivity, we can also find strength and a sense of serenity.</description></item><item><title>Impossible to Ignore by Carmen Simon</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/impossible-to-ignore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/impossible-to-ignore/</guid><description>I am still reading this book, and it is one of the most exciting books I am reading recently, so I decided to do a quick shoutout for it.
Tapping into human memories and becoming a part of their subconscious is a powerful way to deliver memorable messages. Once the message is memorable, it is more likely that people will act on your initial message. But how does that work?</description></item><item><title>Yes! 50 Scientifically Ways to Be Persuasive by Robert B. Cialdini</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/50-scientifically-ways-to-be-persuasive/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/50-scientifically-ways-to-be-persuasive/</guid><description>My review of the book &amp;ldquo;Yes! 50 Scientifically Ways to Be Persuasive.&amp;rdquo;
We both persuade people and get influenced by others, perhaps every single day, without even realizing it. And some of them are based on ethical principles. But some are not.
Knowing persuasion will make you more resilient against the dark ones. It will also make you more persuasive for your message.
Remember, though; these simple techniques are not to work 100% of the time, like almost everything else.</description></item><item><title>Make Your Point by Kevin Carroll and Bob Elliott</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/make-your-point/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/make-your-point/</guid><description>My Review of the book &amp;ldquo;Make Your Point&amp;rdquo;
Weak communication can cause you lose a HONDA CRV every week. Communication is crucial for success.
Take me for example. I have 10 meetings every day on average. Sometimes it is 14. Let’s make it a humble number. Take 5 meetings. Most of them have around 5 people on average and last for about an hour. Let’s take the 80$ per hour rate.</description></item><item><title>Win Bigly by Scott Adams</title><link>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/win-bigly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.bookreviews.io/posts/win-bigly/</guid><description>My review on the book “Win Bigly” by Scott Adams:
Persuasion is clearly crucial for success. It is everywhere. It is almost impossible to escape from it. We use it even we don’t realize it. It is fine until it is not. Some people engineer their persuasion skills. It is like fire. You can use it for cooking delicious food or hurting others.
Scott Adams explains the practical use of persuasion using Donald Trump as an example.</description></item></channel></rss>
